The solution has 2 projects:
1. TestCode. 
   This project contains a class called F1Stats that has 2 methods that must be implemented.
   The SampleData class has test data so you can see the data structure you must use in order to complete the assignment.
     If you want to pass the sample data into F1Stats: var f1Stats = new F1Stats(SampleData.Teams);
2. TestCodeTests
   This is a empty project. 
   You are free to add any test and/or mocking framework in order to test the methods you must implemented in F1Stats.
   Note we have added a commented out method just to show a very simple test. It is just for illustrative purposes.
   
   
What must be completed:
  Inside F1Stats are 2 methods with ToDos that must be implemented. These are DriverByCarNo and TeamWinPercentage.
  Read the ToDo's in order to understand what each method must do.

  You must implement these 2 methods + all tests (in the test project) you feel are relevant.
  Do not implement console or forms applications. Just the code in the 2 methods and tests. 
    

Note that we have supplied a sample stub for IF1StatsWeighting in the test project.
We are not concerned about the implementation of the Apply method in this interface (return 1 for the sake of testing and a exception if the driver total races is less than 100) but rather verifying it is called under the correct circumstances.
